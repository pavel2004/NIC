## Genetic algorithm for playing Geometry Dash

### Introduction

This project explores the use of Genetic algorithm to optimize player controls in the clone of "Geometry Dash". The objective is to create an AI-controlled vehicle that can solve level of game by learning from its experiences.

### Setup

- Install Python 3.x and its dependencies (neat, socket, json)
- Install Unity
- Clone this repository to your local machine

### Usage

To run the NEAT algorithm:

1. Write in console uvicorn main:app --reload
2. Press Play button in unity

### Expected Results

After training, the GA algorithm is expected to produce a solving map

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- neat
- socket
- json
